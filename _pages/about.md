## What are 'DRMC Modules'?

David Rumsey Map Center's 'Modules' are a set of pre-made classes that professors can request we deliver to their students. Each 'module' refers to a one-time lesson on a given topic based on the collection of maps we have in the center. Currently we have two such modules, namely 'California as an Island' and 'Charting the Northwest Passage'.

## Who can avail of these modules?

Anyone can use the materials available on this site. Each module is designed to be delivered either in-person at the center in Stanford's Green Library, or in a separate classroom setting. However, we recommend coming to the center in person to view the selected materials up-close.

## Physical maps, atlases, and globes

Most of our physical maps are housed in two libraries: the **David Rumsey Map Center** and **Branner Earth Science Library & Map Collections**. The Rumsey Center primarily specializes in rare and historic material that needs special care and must be viewed by appointment in the center. Branner primarily houses more contemporary (20th c. and newer) material which can usually be checked out. Depending on your research topic you may find useful maps in both collections. Library staff in both branches are available to help you locate and work with relevant collection material regardless of where it is physically stored.
